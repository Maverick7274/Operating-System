# Introduction to operating system

## Operating system and functions

1. An operating system (OS) is a software program that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

2. It acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware, enabling the user to interact with the computer and run applications.

3. The main function of an operating system is to ensure that various applications and users can use the computer hardware resources in a controlled and efficient manner.

The functions of an operating system can be categorized into four main areas:

* **Process management**: The OS manages processes, which are running programs. It allocates system resources, such as CPU time and memory, to processes, and schedules them for execution.

* **Memory management**: The OS manages the computer's memory, allocating and deallocating memory as needed for processes and ensuring that each process has access only to its own memory space.

* **Device management**: The OS manages the computer's input/output devices, such as keyboards, mice, and printers, and provides a way for applications to communicate with them.

* **File management**: The OS manages the computer's file system, organizing and storing files and directories, and providing a way for applications to access them.

In summary, an operating system is a crucial component of a computer system, providing the foundation for running applications and managing system resources.


## Evolution of operating system

The evolution of operating systems can be traced through different phases in the history of computing. These phases reflect changes in the hardware, software, and user requirements, leading to the development of different types of operating systems. Here are some key phases in the evolution of operating systems:

### Batch processing systems:
Batch processing was the earliest form of computing, where data was processed in large batches, usually overnight, without any user interaction. In this system, programs were executed sequentially and output was printed on paper. Batch processing systems used operating systems that were designed to manage the execution of jobs in batches, such as IBM's OS/360.

### Interactive systems:
As computer systems became more powerful, users demanded more control over the computing process. Interactive systems allowed users to interact with the computer in real-time and obtain immediate feedback. Operating systems such as UNIX and Windows were designed to support interactive computing.

### Multiprogramming systems:
Multiprogramming systems were designed to improve the utilization of computer resources. In a multiprogramming system, multiple programs could be executed simultaneously, with the operating system managing the sharing of resources. Multiprogramming systems allowed for greater efficiency and reduced waiting times. Examples of multiprogramming systems include IBM's MVS and UNIX.

### Time-sharing systems:
Time-sharing systems were an improvement on multiprogramming systems, allowing multiple users to share the same computer system. In a time-sharing system, each user was given a time slice during which they could interact with the computer. Time-sharing systems allowed for greater efficiency and improved interactivity, with the user receiving near-instantaneous feedback. Examples of time-sharing systems include UNIX and CP/M.

### Real-time systems:
Real-time systems were designed to support applications that required immediate response times. In a real-time system, the operating system must respond to events in a timely manner, usually in fractions of a second. Real-time systems are used in applications such as aerospace, defense, and medical devices.

### Multiprocessor systems:
Multiprocessor systems allow for multiple processors to work together on a single task. The operating system must manage the distribution of tasks among the processors and ensure that they work together efficiently. Multiprocessor systems are used in high-performance computing applications.

### Distributed systems:
Distributed systems are a modern development in operating systems. In a distributed system, multiple computers are connected to form a single logical system. The operating system must manage the distribution of tasks and resources among the different computers. Distributed systems are used in applications such as cloud computing and peer-to-peer networking.

In summary, the evolution of operating systems has been driven by changes in hardware, software, and user requirements, leading to the development of batch, interactive, multiprogramming, time-sharing, real-time, multiprocessor, and distributed systems. Each type of operating system has its own unique characteristics and advantages, reflecting the diverse needs of computer users over time.

## System Protection on Operating Systems

System protection refers to the measures taken by an operating system to ensure the security and integrity of a computer system. This involves protecting the system from unauthorized access, ensuring the confidentiality of user data, preventing system crashes and errors, and maintaining system availability.

There are several mechanisms that an operating system can use to provide system protection, including:

1. **Access control**: Access control mechanisms are used to restrict access to system resources, such as files, devices, and memory. Access control can be implemented through user accounts, passwords, and permissions.

2. **Authentication**: Authentication mechanisms are used to verify the identity of users or processes that are accessing the system. Authentication can be based on passwords, biometrics, or cryptographic keys.

3. **Encryption**: Encryption mechanisms are used to protect the confidentiality of data by converting it into a form that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized users. Encryption can be applied to files, communication channels, and storage devices.

4. **Auditing**: Auditing mechanisms are used to track and record system activity, such as logins, file access, and resource usage. Auditing can be used for security and compliance purposes.

5. **Error detection and recovery**: Error detection and recovery mechanisms are used to detect and correct errors that may occur in the system. This can involve techniques such as checksums, redundancy, and backup and recovery systems.

6. **Firewalls**: Firewalls are used to restrict network traffic to and from the system, providing an additional layer of security against unauthorized access and malware.

Overall, system protection is a critical component of an operating system, as it helps to ensure the security, integrity, and availability of the computer system. Operating systems must continuously adapt to new threats and vulnerabilities, implementing new protection mechanisms as necessary to provide a safe and reliable computing environment.

## Operating system structure

The structure of an operating system refers to the organization and architecture of the various components that make up the operating system. The structure determines how the operating system manages system resources, interacts with applications, and provides services to users. The following are the main components of an operating system structure:

* **Kernel**: The kernel is the core of the operating system, responsible for managing system resources and providing services to applications. The kernel handles tasks such as process management, memory management, and input/output operations.

* **Device drivers**: Device drivers are software components that provide an interface between the operating system and hardware devices such as printers, network cards, and storage devices. Device drivers enable the operating system to communicate with and control the hardware devices.

* **System libraries**: System libraries are collections of software modules that provide services to applications, such as file I/O, networking, and graphical user interfaces. System libraries provide a standard interface between applications and the operating system.

* **Shell**: The shell is the interface between the user and the operating system. The shell provides a command-line interface or graphical user interface for users to interact with the operating system.

* **System utilities**: System utilities are programs that perform system management tasks such as system configuration, performance monitoring, and security management. System utilities are typically accessed through the shell or graphical user interface.

* **Application programming interfaces (APIs)**: APIs are interfaces that allow applications to access operating system services and resources. APIs provide a standard set of functions for applications to use, enabling applications to be developed independently of the operating system.

* **File system**: The file system is responsible for managing files and directories on storage devices such as hard drives and flash drives. The file system provides a hierarchical organization of files and directories, and enables users and applications to store and retrieve data.

Overall, the structure of an operating system is designed to provide a cohesive and integrated environment for managing system resources, running applications, and providing services to users. The components of the operating system structure work together to provide a seamless and efficient computing experience for users.

## Operating system services

Operating system services are the various functions and tasks that an operating system performs to manage computer resources and provide a platform for running applications. These services include:

* **Process management**: The operating system manages processes, which are the running instances of programs. It allocates system resources, such as memory and CPU time, to processes and schedules them for execution.

* **Memory management**: The operating system manages memory by allocating and deallocating memory for processes, and ensuring that each process has access to the memory it needs. Memory management also involves virtual memory, which enables the operating system to use a portion of the hard drive as if it were additional memory.

* **File system management**: The operating system provides a file system that enables users and applications to organize and store data on storage devices. File system management includes creating, deleting, and modifying files and directories, as well as providing access control and security features.

## System Program and Calls in Operating System

* System programs are software programs that perform various system-level tasks, such as managing system resources, providing system services, and performing system maintenance.

* These programs are typically part of the operating system and are designed to interact directly with the hardware and system-level resources of the computer.

* System calls, also known as system services or system-level functions, are the interface between system programs and the operating system.

* System calls are used by system programs to request services or resources from the operating system, such as allocating memory or accessing a file.

* System calls provide a standardized interface between applications and the operating system, enabling applications to be developed independently of the underlying hardware and operating system.

The following are examples of system programs and system calls:

* **Compiler**: A compiler is a system program that translates high-level programming languages into machine language. The compiler interacts with the operating system through system calls to allocate memory and access the file system.

* **Device driver**: A device driver is a system program that manages the interaction between the operating system and a hardware device, such as a printer or a network card. Device drivers use system calls to request resources and services from the operating system.

* **Shell**: The shell is a system program that provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the operating system. The shell uses system calls to perform tasks such as creating and deleting files and directories.

* **Process management**: Process management is a system program that manages the creation, execution, and termination of processes. Process management uses system calls to allocate memory, schedule processes, and manage process communication.

* **File management**: File management is a system program that provides services for managing files and directories. File management uses system calls to create, open, read, write, and close files.

System programs and system calls are critical components of the operating system structure. They enable applications to access system resources and services, and provide a standardized interface for applications to interact with the operating system.
